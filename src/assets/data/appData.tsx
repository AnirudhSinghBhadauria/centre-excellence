      "COE-AIML and COE-PERE are the first COEs in the respective sectors in Madhya Pradesh. They are driven by a collaborative cohort of researchers drawn from multiple disciplines to solve the most critical problems related to AI/ML and PE/RE for multi-domain operations. A centre of excellence (COE) is a team of skilled knowledge workers whose mission is to provide the organisation they work for with best practices around a particular area of interest. The concept of creating special-interest groups for thought leadership originated in lean manufacturing. Depending upon the organization and area of interest.Center of Excellence (CoE) is a body that provides leadership, best practices, research, support, training of trainers and skill training for a specific sector/s. The literal meaning of a COE is â€“ 'A place where the highest standards are maintained.",
